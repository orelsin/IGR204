We can see that the name Marie has been very popular for more than 30 years even if there have been some changes in Ile de France.

The same goes for the name Jean, even if the monopoly is less obvious, with a north/south split with the name Andr√© at the beginning of the 20th century.

In these two images we can see that from the 1950s onwards this monopoly disappears and popular names change more rapidly. It can also be seen that this evolution is taking place at the same time for both types of gender present in the data. Thanks to this diversification, we can see geographical clusters appearing, which clearly show that the trends for first names are by zone in France. When we look at the year 1960, we also see that the distribution of first names is the same for both genders, which reinforces this idea of geographical influence for the choice of a name.

From the 1970s onwards, the changes in trends are much more rapid with big differences visible from year to year. When you look at the different visualizations, you can also see a slight difference between men and women. Indeed, for women, a first name often has the monopoly on all France even if it is for a short duration whereas for men, various popular first names cohabit regularly.

From the 2000s to the present day, there has been an increase in the number of rare names. There are two possibilities for this, either the names given today are much more diverse than before, or the database of so-called popular names is not well adapted to recent years and therefore popular names today are classified as rare by the database.
